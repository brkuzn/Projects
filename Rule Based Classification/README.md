Here I’m using persona.cv dataset. This dataset includes the pricing of a mobile application and its users’ age, nationality, gender. I’m re-observing these variables by creating new and more inclusive personas and segmenting them according to average spending. Thus, we can predict  how much profit we can make from different kinds of customers.
